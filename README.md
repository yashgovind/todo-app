# toDO-aPp


This is my First to-do app in backend , ive made the api from a beginner point of view and i have not added professional folder structure , this was intented to make me practice crud operations with a Database ..

you can clone the app using the git clone and then you need to run the following commands  to install the mongoose ,
nodemon and express :--->

```npm init -y``` To initialize node in the repo

```npm i express mongodb mongoose nodemon  ``` to install dependencies

``` npx run nodemon index.js``` as index.js is a main file , you can alternatively set up   the scripts the following way and run the following command below :-->

``` "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon start "
  },
```
you can then run the command ```npm run dev ``` 

you can set up the port however you like , my default port is 8000. you can use any of the others
